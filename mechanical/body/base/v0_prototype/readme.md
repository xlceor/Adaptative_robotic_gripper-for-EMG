# Base v0

## Purpose
Base of the four-bar linkage. It serves as a support and for storing the electronics, including the servo.

## Geometry
The shape was designed to priorize stability. In this version, the base only acts as a support for prototyping.

## Material
PLA or PETG, depending on testing

## Observations
Conceptual model. The design are not tested on real life. I'll adjust the lenght and shape depending on results of testing
## Next Step
3D print the model to test shape and validate size.
