# Linkage bar v0.1

## Purpose
link base that connects the TPU finger to the base via the mechanism.

## Geometry
The shape was designed to reduce weight while maintaining strength. 

## Material
PLA or PETG, depending on testing

## Observations
Unlike the previous model, this version consists of two separate pieces for improved printing. The pieces are connected by a screw for added stability. Additionally, the head width has been reduced for compatibility with screws.

## Next Step
3D print the model to test performance
