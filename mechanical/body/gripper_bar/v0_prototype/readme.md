# Linkage bar v0

## Purpose
Initial link base that connects the TPU finger to the base via the mechanism.

## Geometry
The shape was designed to reduce weight while maintaining strength.

## Material
PLA or PETG, depending on testing

## Observations
Conceptual model. I'll adjust the form to be more strong and use less filament in future versions.
## Next Step
3D print the model to test performance
