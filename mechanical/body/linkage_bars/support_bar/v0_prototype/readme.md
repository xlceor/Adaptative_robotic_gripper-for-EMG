# Support bar v0

## Purpose
Secondary bar of the two support bars. Gives stability.

## Geometry
The shape was minimalist, adjusting the witdh in base on srew-holes

## Material
PLA or PETG, depending on testing

## Observations
Conceptual model. Actually is just for support, so a complex shape is not needed. In future versions I'll adjust the shape for more complex mechanism
## Next Step
3D print the model to test shape and validate size.
