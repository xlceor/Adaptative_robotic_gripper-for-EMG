# TPU Finger Prototype v0

## Purpose
Initial experiment to create a compliant finger using TPU, based on observations of similar models.

## Geometry
Right triangle base with parallel internal bending lines to allow controlled deformation.

## Material
TPU 95A

## Observations
Conceptual model. The thickness is based on approximations, but actual performance and future iterations will depend on prototyping.

## Next Step
3D print the model to test performance
